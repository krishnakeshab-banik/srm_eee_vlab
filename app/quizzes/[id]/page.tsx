        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "In staircase wiring (and all electrical installations), the neutral wire should NEVER be switched. Only the live wire should be switched for safety reasons. Switching the neutral could leave the circuit energized even when apparently turned off."

    questions: [
      {
        id: 1,
        question: "What is the main purpose of a full-wave rectifier?",
        options: [
          "To convert DC to AC",
          "To convert AC to DC by utilizing both half-cycles of the input",
          "To amplify the input voltage",
          "To reduce voltage ripple without using filters"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The main purpose of a full-wave rectifier is to convert AC to DC by utilizing both half-cycles (positive and negative) of the input AC waveform. This results in more efficient power conversion compared to half-wave rectification."
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        question: "How many diodes are required in a center-tapped full-wave rectifier?",
        options: [
          "One",
          "Two",
          "Four",
          "Six"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "A center-tapped full-wave rectifier requires two diodes. The center tap of the transformer secondary winding is connected to ground, and each diode conducts during alternate half-cycles of the input."
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        question: "How many diodes are required in a bridge full-wave rectifier?",
        options: [
          "Two",
          "Three",
          "Four",
          "Six"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "A bridge full-wave rectifier requires four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration. This arrangement allows full-wave rectification without needing a center-tapped transformer."
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        question: "What is the ripple frequency of a full-wave rectifier with a 50 Hz AC input?",
        options: [
          "25 Hz",
          "50 Hz",
          "100 Hz",
          "200 Hz"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "The ripple frequency of a full-wave rectifier is twice the input frequency. With a 50 Hz AC input, the ripple frequency is 100 Hz. This is because both the positive and negative half-cycles are converted to the same polarity, resulting in two pulses per input cycle."
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        question: "What is the advantage of a bridge rectifier over a center-tapped rectifier?",
        options: [
          "Bridge rectifiers use fewer diodes",
          "Bridge rectifiers don't require a transformer",
          "Bridge rectifiers don't need a center-tapped transformer and provide better voltage utilization",
          "Bridge rectifiers have lower forward voltage drop"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "The main advantage of a bridge rectifier over a center-tapped rectifier is that it doesn't require a center-tapped transformer and provides better voltage utilization. While it uses more diodes (four instead of two), it utilizes the entire secondary voltage, whereas a center-tapped design only uses half of the total secondary voltage at any time."
      },
      {
        id: 6,
        question: "What is the peak inverse voltage (PIV) across each diode in a bridge rectifier?",
        options: [
          "Equal to the peak input voltage",
          "Twice the peak input voltage",
          "Half the peak input voltage",
          "Four times the peak input voltage"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "In a bridge rectifier, the peak inverse voltage (PIV) across each diode is equal to the peak input voltage. This is an advantage over the center-tapped rectifier, where each diode must withstand twice the peak input voltage."
      },
      {
        id: 7,
        question: "What component is typically added to a full-wave rectifier to reduce ripple in the output voltage?",

          "Capacitor",
          "Resistor",
          "Transformer"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "A capacitor is typically added to a full-wave rectifier to reduce ripple in the output voltage. The capacitor charges during the peaks of the rectified waveform and discharges during the valleys, smoothing the output voltage."
      },
      {
        id: 8,
        question: "What is the average DC output voltage of a bridge rectifier in terms of the RMS input voltage?",
        options: [
          "Vdc = 0.318 × Vrms",
          "Vdc = 0.636 × Vrms",
          "Vdc = 0.9 × Vrms",
          "Vdc = 1.414 × Vrms"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The average DC output voltage of a bridge rectifier is Vdc = (2Vm/π) = 0.636 × Vrms, where Vm is the peak voltage and Vrms is the RMS input voltage. This is because Vm = 1.414 × Vrms, and the average value of a full-wave rectified sine wave is 2Vm/π."

        id: 9,
        question: "During which part of the AC cycle do all diodes in a bridge rectifier conduct?",
        options: [
          "All diodes conduct throughout the entire cycle",
          "Two diodes conduct during the positive half-cycle and the other two during the negative half-cycle",
          "All diodes conduct only during the positive half-cycle",
          "None of the diodes conduct simultaneously"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "In a bridge rectifier, two diodes conduct during the positive half-cycle and the other two conduct during the negative half-cycle. At any given time, only two of the four diodes are conducting, forming a series path through the load."

      {
        id: 10,
        question: "What is the form factor of a full-wave rectified waveform without filtering?",

          "1.57",
          "2.0"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The form factor of a full-wave rectified waveform without filtering is 1.11. Form factor is defined as the ratio of RMS value to average value. For a full-wave rectified sine wave, this ratio is π/(2√2) ≈ 1.11."
